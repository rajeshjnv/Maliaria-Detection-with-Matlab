Using convolutional or pretrained AlexNet neural network in MATLAB for detecting and deploying Image Cells that contain Malaria or not!

>> The dataset contains 2 folders - i) Infected ii) Uninfected

>> Using splitEachLabel divided the data into training and validation data sets, 70% of the images for training and 30% for validation.

>> Load the new images as an image datastore which enables us to store large image data, 
  including data that does not fit in memory, and efficiently read batches of images during training of a CNN.

>> The size of the mini-batch used for each training iteration. The default is 128.

>> The initial learning rate by default is 0.01 for solver ‘sgdm’ and 0.001 for solvers ‘adam’ and ‘rmsprop’.
  [ 'sgdm' - Stochastic gradient descent with momentum. ]
  [ 'adam' - Adaptive moment estimation (ADAM). ]
  [ 'rmsprop' - Root mean square propagation (RMSProp). ]

Training options:-

‘GradientDecayFactor’: 0.9
‘SquaredGradientDecayFactor’:  0.999 for ‘adam’ and 0.9 for ‘rmsprop’
‘Epsilon’:  1e-8
‘LearnRateSchedule’:  Nil

>> For sgdm optimizer, and initial learning rate and mini batch size are set to 0.0009 and 64 respectively.

>> Using the command trainNetwork and the specified parameters we train neural network.

>> Finally, the classification output and confidence levels are displayed
